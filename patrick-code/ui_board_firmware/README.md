# Magpie UI Board Microcontroller Board Firmware

## This STM32Cube project encompasses the UI board firmware
- The UI board is primarily responsible for monitoring the power button and shutting down the system
- Power consumption is reduced as much as possible by using low power modes and disabling unused ports and peripherals
- This firmware project is much more basic and limited in scope than the main-board and BLE firmware

## Project organization
- This is an STM32CubeIDE C language project for STM32C011F4U6TR
- STM32 auto generated peripheral code goes into .h/.c file pairs (this reduces clutter in `main.c`) in `./Core/Inc/` and `./Core/Src/`
- Do not modify any code in `./Core/` or `./Drivers/`
- The main application is in `./app/`, and `./app/app_main.c` has the main infinite loop. This function is called by the autogenerated `./Core/Src/main.c`
