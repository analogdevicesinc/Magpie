# SWIFTV2_DSS
## Introduction
The code within this repository consists of multiple firmware projects that implement and/or vet different functional requirements of the SWIFTV2 Digital Subsystems (DSS). SWIFTV2 is a design collaboration between Cornell University’s K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics and Analog Device’s Central Applications Group using ADI’s microcontroller, A2D, and other analog products to power Cornell’s second generation SWIFT autonomous recording units hardware/firmware platform.  This repository represents a good portion of Analog's firmware contribution to the project.
